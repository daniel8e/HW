Method - Best Pasta Recipe in the UNIVERSE !

Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.

Throw the tomatoes into a large roasting tin, drizzle them with olive oil, season with some salt and pepper and pop them in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Once they're roasted, squash the tomatoes with a fork to get the juices going and drizzle over some balsamic vinegar.

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta according to the pack instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and add the roasted tomato sauce and the olives. Tear over most of the basil leaves and toss everything together. Season and serve with the reserved basil leaves scattered over and some freshly grated pecorino.
